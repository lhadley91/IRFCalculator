# IRFCalculator
Takes a VAR system with substituted coefficients from Eviews and calculate the impulse responses. Creates IRFs for each variable.

Decomposition method: residual - units (normally set to 1, but the model takes whatever you input in the input boxes)

See online [here](http://www.lancehadleydesign.com/tools/IRFCalculator/index.html)

Press "Sample System" to see sample system format, then "Generate Table" to populate system values/inputs. Then you will be able to set variable impulses.

I built this specifically to generate IRFs after working with non-standard errors in Eviews (such as HAC).
